Link to Scott Lilly's great tutorial series for making a project alike below. (You might want to check out Scott's older version of this tutorial series utilising WinForms if you begin to feel confused, because it describes more of the basics of C# programming, while the updated version assumes you already know quite a bit about programming in this language.)
